                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>While hockey is stereotypically a sport played by those from the True North <i class="fa fa-copyright" aria-hidden="true"></i>,
                        in practice players in the NHL come from all over the northern hemisphere.</p>

                    <p>This map displays the birth city of every NHL player to have played in at least one game
                        of the 2017-18 season, as of 2017-12-06.</p>

                    <h3>Instructions</h3>
                    <p>The icons to the left allow you to search and filter the map by player, team, or city, respectively. More instructions can be found in each individual tab.</p>

                    <h3>Methodology</h3>
                    <p>Birth city data was taken from the excellent <a href="http://hockey-reference.com">Hockey Reference</a> site,
                    and the city name was geocoded against the <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">Geonames API</a> to get the city's coordinates.
                        I performed a little cleanup on the data by hand, as there were a few weird outliers that were <strong>very</strong>
                        obviously wrong. The Geonames API also has a tendency to choose a municipal airport in some cases,
                        which led to some other weirdness; for example, Sidney Crosby's birth town of Cole Harbor was geocoded
                        to the local airport. I didn't make as much of an effort to clean these up, as by and large they're rather close to where they should be.
                        You'll surely find some
                    other things if you explore the data closely enough. You can find the code I used to perform the data
                    processing <a href="https://github.com/tomplex">on Github</a>. </p>

                    <p>First and foremost, thanks to <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> for creating an amazing free & open source mapping library.</p>

                    <p>This page uses <a href="https://github.com/Turbo87/sidebar-v2">Leaflet-sidebar-v2</a> for the slick sidebar you're reading this in, and
                        <a href="http://listjs.com/overview/">list.js</a> for the easily searchable player, team and city lists.
                    Many thanks to the creators of those libraries, doing a bunch of work that I didn't have to.</p>

                    <p>I had never heard of or used the <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">Geonames API</a> before this project,
                        and without their free city geocoding API, this project would have been DOA. I highly recommend using
                        & contributing to their service.</p>

                    <p>Finally, thanks to <a href="http://hockey-reference.com">Hockey-Reference</a> for maintaining one
                        of the most comprehensive NHL stats sites on the web, and making that data freely available to all.</p>
